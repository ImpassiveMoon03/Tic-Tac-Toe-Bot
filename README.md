# Tic Tac Toe Bot
## About the Project
Tic Tac Toe was created in order to test out my [Node.js](https://node.js.org) library, [tic-tac-nano-2](https://npmjs.org/package/tic-tac-nano-2). 

## Prerequisites
Your machine must run Node.js
<br/><br/>To see if your machine has node installed, open the command terminal and type th following command:<br/>
```
node -v
```
After installing Node, you must generate an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)<br/><br/>
After making an application and generating a bot, you are ready to clone the repo!

## Repo Cloning
Open your terminal and go to the directory you want your project's subfolder to be inside and type the following commands:<br/>
```
git clone https://github.com/ImpassiveMoon03/tic-tac-toe-bot
cd tic-tac-toe-bot
```
Then, run the following commands to install te dependencies and get setup:<br/>
```
npm install
npm run setup
```
After running setup, enter the newly created ".env" file and replace bot_token with your application's token<br/>
After setting up the bot, in order to enable the Slash commands, you must enter index.js and un-comment the command creation.
